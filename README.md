# Civil-Aviation-Analysis

* Data Analysis of Civil Aviation Ministry of India

* Using R programming it becomes easier to analyze the data and vizualize it.

# R libraries and packages used in this Project


1. `ggfortifiy`

Data Visualization Tools for Statistical Analysis Results. Unified plotting tools for statistics commonly used, such as GLM, time series, PCA                             families, clustering and survival analysis.

2. `ggplot2` 

Plotting package that provides helpful commands to create complex plots from data in a data frame. It provides a more programmatic interface for                          specifying what variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual properties.

3. `dplyr`

It is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges.

4. `gganimate`

It provides a range of new functionality that can be added to the plot object in order to customize how it should change with time.

5. `plotly`

Creating interactive web-based graphs via the open source JavaScript graphing library plotly. js.

6. `hrbrthemes`

This is a very focused package that provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.

7. `scales`

Provides the internal scaling infrastructure used by ggplot2, and gives you tools to override the default breaks, labels, transformations and                            palettes.

* Conclusion

    * Indian Goverment investing lots of money for devloping basic infrastructure for Civil Aviation
    * Incresing no of passenger in lst decade, investment also increases and no of airport present in India.
