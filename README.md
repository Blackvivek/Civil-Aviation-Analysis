# Civil-Aviation-Analysis
analyzing the data from Ministry Of Civil Aviation of India 
Our project based on data analysis using r.

In that we use differnt library which are given below.


1)library(ggfortifiy):Data Visualization Tools for Statistical Analysis Results. Unified plotting tools for statistics commonly used, such as GLM, time series, PCA                             families, clustering and survival analysis

2)library(ggplot2):Plotting package that provides helpful commands to create complex plots from data in a data frame. It provides a more programmatic interface for                          specifying what variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual properties.

3)library(dplyr): It is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges.

4)library(gganimate):It provides a range of new functionality that can be added to the plot object in order to customize how it should change with time.

5)library(plotly): Creating interactive web-based graphs via the open source JavaScript graphing library plotly. js.

6)library(hrbrthemes): This is a very focused package that provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.

7)library(scales): Provides the internal scaling infrastructure used by ggplot2, and gives you tools to override the default breaks, labels, transformations and                            palettes.

conclusion: Indian Goverment investing lots of money for devloping basic infrastructure for Civil Aviation. And the effect of that investment we can see in our progects
           i.e Incresing no of passenger in lst decade, investment also increases and no of airport present in India.
